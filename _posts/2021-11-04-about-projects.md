# Linux Kernel Security Book

When I was training one newcomer after another in my work, I realized that I repeated similar knowledge repeatedly. So I decided to write this book to share my modest knowledge about Linux kernel security and help people interested in Linux kernel security.

A book-in-progress about Linux Kernel Security includes attacker view with linux kernel internal, vulnerability hunt, exploitation, mitigation, and more.


# Kernel Exploitation

For HardenedOS members only.

# Kubernetes-HD

A very new project, no more detail.
